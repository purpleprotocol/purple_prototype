/// The hard chain stores blocks that represent state

/// can be thought of as a function which changes the state of
/// the validator pool.

/// From the point of view of the validator pool a
/// block mined on the hard chain represents an
/// injection of:
///
/// 1. An additional amount of events that the whole pool can order.
/// 2. Additional validators.
///
/// The pool cannot start ordering events without a block
/// being mined in the hard chain which states the new
/// validators that will be added (miners of the latest
/// easy chain blocks since that last mined hard block),
/// how many events the pool can order in the next round,
/// and what nodes to retire from the pool.
///
/// At the same time, the next hard block cannot be applied
/// to the pool until the pool has either consumed all of
/// their allocated events or until the pool is deemed to be
/// corrupt.
